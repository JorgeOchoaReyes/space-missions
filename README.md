## Visualizations

The three main visualizations help users see the progression of success rates by time, the most popular launch sites, and the top ten companies. 

The success rate by time is usuful to allow users to see the how launches have improved and when they were at their lowest.

The most popular launch sites is useful to allow users to see where launches are taking place and which sites are the most active.

The top ten companies is useful to allow users to see which companies are the most active and which companies are the most successful.
